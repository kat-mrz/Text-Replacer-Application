# Text Replacer

## Project Overview

This application will take three String inputs: a word/phrase to be replaced, a word/phrase to replace it with, and a body of text. **Every occurence of that word/phrase in the body text will be replaced by the replacer word/phrase.** You can add multiple words to replace for one body of text.

This application is very versatile, but would be particularly useful for people who write many copies of **similarly written documents,** such as **job offer letters** or **report cards.** This project is of interest to me because as a Resident Advisor, I write many similar reports for each of my residents and could increase efficacy by replacing the names and relevant information on a pre-written template.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add a body of text to replace words from.
- As a user, I want to be able to add a replaced/replacer word pairing to a list of word pairings.
- As a user, I want to be able to select a replaced/replacer word pairing and edit either word.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete a replaced/replacer word pairing from the list of word pairings.
