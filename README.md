# Text Replacer

## Project Overview

This application will take three String inputs: a word/phrase to be replaced, a word/phrase to replace it with, and a body of text. **Every occurence of that word/phrase in the body text will be replaced by the replacer word/phrase.** You can add multiple words to replace for one body of text.

This application is very versatile, but would be particularly useful for people who write many copies of **similarly written documents,** such as **job offer letters** or **report cards.** This project is of interest to me because as a Resident Advisor, I write many similar reports for each of my residents and could increase efficacy by replacing the names and relevant information on a pre-written template.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add a replaced/replacer word pairing to a list of word pairings.
- As a user, I want to be able to list all the replacer word pairings in my list of pairings as a report of my history.
- As a user, I want to be able to toggle case sensitivity on/off.
- As a user, I want to be able to save my current body text, replace history, and case sensitivity settings (if I so choose)
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to load my previous body text, replace history, and case sensitivity settings from file (if I so choose)
